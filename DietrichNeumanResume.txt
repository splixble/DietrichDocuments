WORK HISTORY

Mentor Graphics	 Wilsonville, Oregon, 1998 – Present
Software Engineer(Contractor)
Developed Quality Assurance software for Falcon Framework, a software library used by commercial circuit board design and verification applications, which runs on several UNIX platforms as well as Windows NT using the UNIX emulator NuTCracker. Ported QA suites from UNIX to NT. Cleaned up earlier porting work to make QA suites portable, automatic, and able to be run predictably and easily. (NT, HPUX, Solaris, SunOs, NuTCracker, C++, Korn shell, TET, gmake, CVS)
Updated parallel code to enable building the library software, printing utility, and QA suites entirely in the Microsoft Developer Studio, with the resulting executables identical to those built under Mentor's internal build environment.  (NT, Visual C++ 5.0)
Corrected software defects on NT and UNIX platforms.  Maintained code revision streams in CVS, branching and merging changes by off-site developers after deducing their baseline revision level. (CVS) 
Systematized building and testing procedures based on research as well as trial and error.  Documented and publicized these procedures on internal Web.  (HTML)
 
USNR	 Woodland, Washington, 1995 – 1998
Software Engineer (Contractor)
Primary engineer for a Windows NT-based, networked table editing system. Designed and wrote first version entirely, then carried development through to the first several customer releases.  It featured: 
	Network client layer, to send and receive the structure and content of tables originating on various Ethernet-linked hardware systems, using TCP-IP sockets and an in-house client-server protocol  
	Windows-standard user interface, with extension DLL libraries to represent table data graphically
	Data storage in SQL database tables, via ODBC interface
(Windows NT, Visual C++ 4.0 with MFC, ODBC, Objective Grid)
Designed and wrote utility on VAX ELN to maintain persistent socket connections and establish client-server relationships between network nodes.  Using that code, designed and wrote a server to exchange tables between the NT-based table editor and a 10-year-old legacy system on VAX ELN.  Created several other VAX ELN-based servers to be used by other NT-based client applications.  (VAX ELN, Pascal)

Magellan Communications   Sunnyvale, California, 1994
Quality Assurance Engineer, Software Engineer (Contractor)
Created a system of formal quality assurance for a phone mail hardware/software system.  This included a 170-page test plan covering functional specification compliance, and several portable C programs to test low-level functions and simulate normal usage of the system.  (QNX, PDP-11, C)
Maintained and debugged source code, and integrated several engineers’ code changes into an RCS source code control system.  Maintained Makefiles. (QNX, C, RCS, make)

National Information Systems, Inc.   San Jose, California, 1991 ­ 1993
Database Software Engineer, Application Programmer/Analyst
Designed and implemented a client-server interface for RDM, a multi-platform relational database and application development system with over 1000 installations.  This interface enables RDM to access remote RDM and ORACLE database tables over DECNET and other networks.  (VMS, C, Embedded SQL, ORACLE, DECNET, VMS RTL and System Services, p2c)
Ported RDM from VAX VMS to Alpha AXP OpenVMS.  (C, Pascal, VMS System Services)
Performed extensive debugging of RDM, involving every level of development from assembler code to customers’ developed applications.  Responsible for all maintenance development of RDM under VMS.  (VMS, MS-DOS, UNIX, C, Pascal, VAX Macro, VMS System Services, VMS Debugger, CodeView)
Developed new features, enhancements, and innovations to RDM, including screen refresh optimization, control-C trapping, and multi-user record access. (C, Pascal, VMS System Services, VMS RMS)
Quality Assurance Manager and lead Release Engineer for two major releases of RDM.  Primary author of release notes for both.  (VMS, MS-DOS, UNIX, RDM)
Created and maintained RCS-based source control system in VAX DCL for RDM. (VMS, RCS, DCL)
Lead customer support engineer for ProRDM, a high-level language interface for RDM.   Performed telephone, dial-up, written, and on-site support services.  (VMS, RDM, MS-DOS, Novell)

Interactive Technology, Inc.   Beaverton, Oregon, 1986 ­ 1991
Database Software Engineer, Technical Writer
Maintained, debugged, and wrote enhancements to RDM, as at NIS.  Quality Assurance Manager and Release Engineer for three major releases of RDM, and lead customer support engineer for ProRDM.  (VMS, MS-DOS, UNIX, RSX, TSX, RSTS, Pascal, C, VAX Macro, DEC Test Manager)
Designed and implemented enhanced B*tree indexing system for RDM.  (Pascal, VMS RMS) 
Primary author of Skylight Guide to Application Programming, a guide to a commercial API toolkit for developing object-oriented graphical user interface (GUI) applications.  Editor and co-author of three other volumes of Skylight documentation totaling over 450 pages.  (C)
